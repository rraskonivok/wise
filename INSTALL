Install
-------------------------------------


1. Get the wise source code and install to a directory of your
   choice.

   Stable releases can be downloaded from Github::

        https://github.com/sdiehl/wise/archives/master

   Development version can be obtained by git::

        git clone git://github.com/sdiehl/wise


2. You'll need Python 2.6+ (but not Python 3) and the Python
   header files On Ubuntu::

        $ sudo apt-get install python python-dev

   and the Python package managmenent tools::

        $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools build-essential
        $ sudo easy_install -U pip
        $ sudo pip install -U virtualenv


3. Install Pure and LLVM:

   If you are on Ubuntu/Debian you can use the build script
   included with Wise which should install the packages
   `llvm, libgmp3-dev, g++`, and build Pure from source::

        $ ./dist/build_pure.sh

   If your distribution does not carry Pure and LLVM then you can 
   find directions for compiling it from source here::

        http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/pure/INSTALL


4. Set up a new virtualenv, if you aren't using virtualenv then
   start today! If this is your first virtualenv then run the
   following two commands::

        $ mkdir -p ~/.virtualenvs
        $ cd ~/.virtualenvs

   Create a Wise virtualenv::

        $ virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute wise

   To activate the new virtualenv shell run::

        $ source ~/.virtualenvs/wise/bin/activate

   which gives you a shell where all commands are run run in your
   local virtualenv. From here on commands prefixed with::

        $(wise)

   refer to commands that should be
   run in the wise virtualenv shell.


5. Install python libraries::

       (wise)$ pip install -r /path/to/wise/dir/requirements.txt

6. Build the Pure module::

        (wise)$ cd wise
        (wise)$ make


7. Create the database::

        (wise)$ cd wise/
        (wise)$ python mange.py syncdb

   This will prompt you to create a admin user and create
   the local database in the file `wise.db`.


8. Run Wise and login with your admin account::

        (wise)$ gunicorn_django
        (wise)$ firefox localhost:8000/home
