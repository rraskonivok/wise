General Installation on Linux / OS X:
-------------------------------------

1) Install:

        python 2.x 
        pip 
        sqlite3

    from your distributions repository. On Ubuntu these are
    installed by default. 

    *Note, if you are using Python2.7 then you will need to
    adjust the Makefile in (4) to use '/usr/include/python2.7'.


2) Install Pure and LLVM:

   a) There are packages are source code available for Fedora, Arch,
   OS X and a few other package managers available here:

       http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang 

   If your distribution does not carry pure then you can find
   directions for compiling from source here:
        
        http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/pure/INSTALL

   b) It is highly likely that your distribution has a package for
   LLVM, but if you need to compile from source you can find
   directions on the pure site:

        http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/pure/INSTALL


3) Install python libraries:

    $ sudo pip install django gunicorn cython pysqlite

4) Build the Pure module
    
    $ cd wise/worksheet/pure
    $ make

    You may need to adjust the the include directory in Makefile
    if you have a nonstandard install of Python 2.6, the default
    search path is '/usr/include/python2.6'

5) Create the database:
    
    $ cd wise/
    $ python mange.py syncdb

    This will prompt you to create a admin user and create
    the local database in wise.db

6) Run Wise:
    
    $ gunicorn_django 

    This will run the Wise worksheet at 'localhost:8000' by
    default. To use a different address or port use the -b switch

    Example:

    $ gunicorn_django -b 192.168.0.1:1234
