General Installation on Linux / OSX:
-------------------------------------

1) You'll need Python 2.6+ (but not Python 3) and distribution
    tools: On Ubuntu:

        $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
        $ sudo easy_install -U pip
        $ sudo pip install -U virtualenv


2) Install Pure and LLVM:

   If you are on Ubuntu/Debian you can use the included build
   script

        $ ./dist/build_pure.sh

   If you are not on Ubuntu then, it is highly likely that your
   distribution has a package for LLVM, but if you need to
   compile from source you can find directions on the pure site:

        http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/pure/INSTALL

   There are packages are source code available for Fedora, Arch,
   OS X and a few other package managers available here:

        http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang

   If your distribution does not carry Pure then you can find
   directions for compiling LLVM from source here:

        http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/hg/pure/INSTALL


3) Set up a new virtualenv, if you aren't using virtualenv then
   start today! If this is your first virtualenv then run the
   following two commands:

        $ mkdir -p ~/.virtualenvs
        $ cd ~/.virtualenvs

   Create a Wise virtualenv:

        $ virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute wise

   To Activate the new enviroment run:

        $ source wise/bin/activate

   which gives you a shell where all commands run in python are
   run in your local virtualenv. From here on comamnds prefixed
   with:

        $(wise)

   refer to commands that should be
   run in the wise virtualenv shell.

   Install python libraries:

       (wise)$ pip install -r /path/to/wise/dir/requirements.txt

   If you are a developer you may want the optional packages

       (wise)$ pip install -r /path/to/wise/dir/optional.txt


4) Get the wise source code

    Stable releases can be downloaded from Github:

        https://github.com/sdiehl/wise/archives/master

    Development version can be obtained by git:

        git clone git://github.com/sdiehl/wise


5) Build the Pure module

        $ cd wise
        $ make


6) Create the database:

        (wise)$ cd wise/
        (wise)$ python mange.py syncdb

    This will prompt you to create a admin user and create
    the local database in wise.db


7) Run Wise:

        (wise)$ gunicorn_django

    This will run the Wise worksheet at 'localhost:8000' by
    default. To use a different address or port use the -b switch

    Example:

        (wise)$ gunicorn_django -b 192.168.0.1:1234
