Sooo, you want to hack on Wise. Right now its sorted up ugly
twisted spaghetti code that I'm untangeling but it it fairly
well documented. 

Feel free to fork the project Github at
https://github.com/sdiehl/wise

I can also be reached at:
sdiehl@clarku.edu

Most of the code is Django boilerplate stuff and can be skimmed
but the big program logic files are:

Worksheet Stuff:
----------------

* static/js/tree.js  ( this is the *big* one, contains models for all
the expression handeling )

* static/js/worksheet.js
* static/js/worksheet_managers.js
* static/js/worksheet_views.js

To understand all the ajax that goes on read

* urls.py
* worksheet/ajax.py

And the rest API is written with Django Piston

* api/handlers.py

Pure Stuff:
----------------

pure/pure.pyx ( this is the Cython module that makes Python and
Pure play nice )

* translators/pure_wrap.py
* translators/pytopure.py

Mathy Stuff:
----------------

* base/term.py
* base/objects.py

If you want to make your own package then take a look at
/pkgtemplate as a starting point.
