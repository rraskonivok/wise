I'm always happy to receive feedback!

Most of the code is Django boilerplate stuff and can be skimmed
but the big program logic files are:

Maths Stuff:
----------------

    * packages/base/term.py
    * packages/base/objects.py
    * packages/base/*.pure


Pure Stuff:
----------------

    * pure/cpure.pyx
    * translators/pure_wrap.py
    * translators/pytopure.py


Worksheet Stuff:
----------------

    Worksheet:

    * static/js/tree.js
    * static/js/worksheet.js
    * static/js/worksheet_managers.js
    * static/js/worksheet_views.js

    To understand all the ajax that goes on read

    * urls.py
    * worksheet/ajax.py

    And the REST API is written with Django Piston

    * api/handlers.py

If you want to make your own package then take a look at
/pkgtemplate as a starting point.
