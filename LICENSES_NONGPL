have reason to believe the original author Jesper Noehr released

OpenMath CDs
----------------------

This document is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, 
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
provided that the following conditions are met.
  a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
     this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
     work to the original source.
  b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
     document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
     both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
     then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
     chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
     the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
     Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
     Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
     not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
     However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
     is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
     for future extensions.
  c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
     compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
     intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
     work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
society at http://www.openmath.org.
