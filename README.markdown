Wise is an *simple* computer algebra system with a web notebook
interface. It is very much a work in progress at this time.

The goal of Wise is to provide a digital scratchpad that makes 
manipulating symbolic expressions fluid, fast, and extensible.

In addition to being a simple standalone app I hope to make 
exporting formalism from Wise to other open source programs
like Sage / Sympy and LaTeX very seamless.
